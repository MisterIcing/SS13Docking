# Basic Information
- All dockerfiles should be self sufficient in terms of dependencies and files
- To update any files in the image, like maps, have them in the same directory as the Dockerfile
	- Files placed under `/app/Yogstation-master/`
	- Same structure as the Yogstation repo
- Mountable directories
	- `/app/Yogstation-master/data`
	- `/app/Yogstation-master/config`
- Logging
	- A log file is created under `/app`
	- All DreamDaemon outputs are appended to it
		- Good Luck finding the right date if done multiple times
	- Also ignore the missing `log_write` as it should be out of my control
---
- ## Dockerfile
	- Exposes `1337`
		- Any modification will require DreamDaemon's port to change too
- ## Dockerfile.ngrok
	- Exposing is done by ngrok
	- Needs `build-arg` of valid ngrok key
		- auth=[key]
---
- ## ip.py
	- This is just for reference
	- The code is already in Dockerfile.ngrok
